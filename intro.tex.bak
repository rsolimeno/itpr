\end{wrapfigure}This series of eighteen articles was originally written in 1988 to appear in Nuts \&{} Volts, the newsletter of the San Francisco Amateur Radio Club. The series has been widely distributed since then, with revisions issued in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Occasional revisions were made to this version on the web thereafter, in the late 1990s.

The author is no longer active in packet radio and is unable to provide up to date information on packet radio; however he has left this material on the Internet for access by those who might find it helpful.
