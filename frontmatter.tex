COPYRIGHT AND MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION\\

The eighteen parts of this ```Introduction to Packet Radio'' are not copyrighted. They may be copied, printed, duplicated, distributed, and published in newsletters without further permission from me. I, however, request the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item that I be given credit for writing the material
\item that none of the content, including callsigns, be changed
\item that it be stated that the latest edition of the series is available in its entirety at this website (http://www.choisser.com/packet/)
\item that on the Web, links be made to this site rather than posting copies (so the latest edition will be read by packet users).
\end{itemize}


This material is no longer actively updated, although corrections to outdated information are welcome.

73, Larry Kenney, WB9LOZ
